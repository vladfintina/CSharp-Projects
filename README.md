# CSharp-Projects
Repository containing one large project and some of smaller dimensions.

The large project(Semestrial Project) represents an app where the user can store movies, delete, update or even filter them. It uses the OOP principles and more details about it can be found in its documentation folder.

The rest of the folders contain some different projects in C# implemented during my time as an Erasmus student at Chrales University in Prague.
